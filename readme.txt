ErrorsProcessing.c
This project is about balance bracket-matching algorithm.

The program does following things:-

* Be able to read the source code from a file. (can be .txt or .c file)
* Implement struct and Linkedlist to store the relevant data.
* Able to visualize the basic bracket-matching algorithm.
* Manipulate multiple strings (array of char) to accomplish the task.

# It has a makefile with conditional compilation.
